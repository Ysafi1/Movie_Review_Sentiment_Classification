#### Movie Review Sentiment Classification Analysis

This project provides a dataset containing movie reviews paired with binary sentiment labels (positive or negative). Its main purpose is to serve as a standardized benchmark for evaluating the performance of sentiment classification models. The binary labels indicate whether each review expresses a positive or negative sentiment, making the dataset a valuable resource for training and testing sentiment analysis algorithms.
