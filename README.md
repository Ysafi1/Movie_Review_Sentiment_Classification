### *Movie Review Sentiment Classification Analysis*

This project provides a dataset containing movie reviews paired with binary sentiment labels (positive, negative or neutral). Its main purpose is to serve as a standardized benchmark for evaluating the performance of sentiment classification models. The binary labels indicate whether each review expresses a positive or negative sentiment, making the dataset a valuable resource for training and testing sentiment analysis algorithms.

### *Project Objectives*

The objective of this challenge is to, given a sentence, classify whether the sentence is of positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. For messages conveying both a positive and negative sentiment, whichever is the stronger sentiment should be chosen. Predict if the text would be considered positive, negative, or neutral (for an average user). This is a binary task.
